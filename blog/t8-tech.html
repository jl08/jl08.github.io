      <p class="blogTitle">Regular Expressions</p>

      <p class="entryDate">080915</p>

      <section>

        <p>Regular expressions (regex/regexp) are used to look for a specific set of patterns in strings.</p>

        <p>They are basically a sequence of characters that allow you to look through and pick out the characters in the string that match that specific sequence.</p>

        <p>When looking at regular expressions, there are two types of characters: </p>

        <p>A metacharacter, carries a special meaning.</p>

        <p>A regular character, which just carries its literal meaning. </p>

        <p> With both types of characters combined, a pattern can be specified.</p>

        <p>There are certain operations that allow us to create regular expressions:</p>

        <p> The"or" operator is represented by a vertical bar |</p>
        <p> For instance, if you wanted to find the word mum and mom, it would look like mum|mom</p>

        <p> To group things together, parentheses can be used. They allow us to define the scope and the order we want the operators to be in. For example, mum|mom can also be written m(u|o)m.</p>

        <p> A question mark ? after a character tells us how often that character can occur. For example, if we were to write colou?r, the ? mark after the character 'u' shows that there can be zero or one of the character 'u'. This would give us both "color" and "colour".</p>

        <p> An asterisk * tells us that there is zero or more of the character that precedes it. For example, if we did jenn*y, it could give "jeny", jenny", "jennny", etc. </p>

        <p> A plus sign + tells us there is one or more of the character that precedes it. Again, if we used this on jenn+y, it could give us "jenny", "jennny"," jennnny", but not "jeny".</p>

        <p> And of course, we can combine these operations if you wanted to locate a very complex expression.</p>

        <p> Regular expressions can look intimidating and confusing at first, but with a little guidance and practice, it can be a very useful tool!</p>
