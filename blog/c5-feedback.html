       <p>So far, pairing with others has helped me in more ways than one.</p>

       <p> I think what I enjoy most about pairing is the idea that we both have to work collaboratively to solve a problem. Not only do we get insight into what and how the other person is thinking, but we get to learn from them new ways to solve the same problem.</p>

       <p> Receiving feedback has definitely helped me with my learning not only to code, but also with how to code with others. Through feedback, I was able to see some areas where I might be weak or strong in that I myself may have not noticed by myself. When others point out what I can do to improve for a future exercise, I see it as a learning opportunity to become better than what I was before. </p>

       <p> From the feedback that I have recieved so far, I have tried to pseudocode more and think outloud more when coding with partners. I have also tried to make my code comments more concise and specific to make it easier for others to read.</p>

       <p> Overall, I really enjoy pairing with others and recieving feedback. I find them very helpful to my learning experience because it allows me to see things in a different perspective and find areas of weakenesses or strengths that I may not be aware of myself. </p>
