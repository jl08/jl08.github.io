      <h1>arrays vs. hashes</h1>

        <p>Arrays are basically ordered collections of any type of object.

        An array is written like so:

        array_name = [ "Hello", 8, "cheese"]

        You can refer to any object in the array by an index. What is important to note is that the index starts at 0 and not at 1.

        So if I wanted to refer to the object "Hello", I would have to write out:

        array_name[0]

        and this would point us to "Hello"

        Hashes are kind of like arrays, but instead of using numbers for indices, in a hash there are key-value pairs.

        A hash can be created like so:

        hash_name = {
          key1 => value1
          key2 => value2
          key3 => value3
        }

        Key-value pairs allow us to refer to specific objects in the hash by their "key".

        For example, if I wanted to refer to value2, I would write:

        hash_name["key2"]

        This would produce our value2.

        So... why use one over the other?

        Although both are used to store data, hashes use specific "names" that link to the object, whereas arrays just use a number system.

        So if you don't want to use numbers to refer to the objects in your array, then use hashes!
