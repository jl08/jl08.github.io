Version control is beneficial because it allows you to keep track of all the changes you make to a file. This way, if you make a mistake somewhere along the way, you can always go back to a previous time and start over.

       Git is a version control program that keeps a record of everything you do to a file and when you do it. It is basically a program that takes a snapshot of your work and lets you come back to it later if you need. Programmers and developers can use to keep track of their code.

     GitHub is an online community where developers can work together on various coding projects simultaneously. They can collaborate on a project, or work separately on it and then combine it with the main project later without messing up anyone elseâ€™s work. This makes GitHub a very useful tool in creating much larger and complex projects.
