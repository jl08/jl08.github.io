        <p>Version control is beneficial because it allows you to keep track of all the changes you make to a file. This way, if you make a mistake somewhere along the way, you can always go back to a previous time and start over.</p>

        <p>Git is a version control program that keeps a record of everything you do to a  file and when you do it. It is basically a program that takes a snapshot of your work and lets you come back to it later if you need. Programmers and developers can use to keep track of their code.</p>

        <p>GitHub is an online community where developers can work together on various coding projects simultaneously. They can collaborate on a project, or work separately on it and then combine it with the main project later without messing up anyone elseâ€™s work. This makes GitHub a very useful tool in creating much larger and complex projects.</p>
