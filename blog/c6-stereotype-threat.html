        <p>What is a <strong>stereotype threat</strong>?</p>

        <p>Stereotype threat is when negative stereotypes surround a specific social group, which in turn can negatively impact one's performance due to that stereotype.</p>

        <p>In other words, if you belong to a group of people who are stereotyped in a negative way ( and are aware that you belong to this group ),this might have some negative impact on your performance because of that stereotype.</p>

        <p>For example, a girl playing a video game may not play as well as she could have if she is aware of the fact that there is a stereotype that "girls are bad at video games".</p>

        <p>The example above is only a small consequence of negative stereotyping. In the bigger picture of things, negative stereotyping can cause all kinds of consequences.</p>

        <p> Decreased performance could cause a chain of reactions, one being decreased self-esteem, which could in turn lead to decreased motivation to try new things, which can then lead to something else.</p>

        <p> If the girl in the video game example cannot play to her fullest potential because of her knowledge of the idea "girls are bad at video games", she may come to the conclusion that maybe she really is bad, which can eventually discourage her from even trying to play the game altogether.</p>

        <p> It is not so hard to see that negative stereotyping could discourage individuals from entering into specific fields in school and work. Such "filtering" of select groups of people can turn away potentially amazing people from achieving what they can, and consequentially prevent the creation of something truly great.</p>
