     <section>

        <p>I feel that online security is definitely of major concern to the world right now. We store so much of our personal information online without even realizing what consequences it could have later on.</p>
        <p>When we hear on the news that a large company got "hacked" and that some of their employees' personal information was revealed in someway, we panic for that moment and go right back to what we were doing before we heard the news.</p>

        <p>I can't say that I have a great technological way to solve this problem yet... but I can come up with some easy, small steps to try to prevent it, even a little bit.</p>

        <p> One way to start could be to stop saving all your passwords so that it automatically logs on to anything! I know we are all forgetful, and sometimes can feel lazy about typing in passwords, but it'll make it a bit better to know that someone can't just "click" into your personal stuff. After all, the password is there for a reason, right? </p>

        <p> This next one... is pretty much in line with the first suggestion. Try not to auto-save so much personal information, like frequently used credit card for instance, or any other valuable information that only you should know.</p>

        <p> The list could go on, but it just comes down to one thing-- don't rely on technology too much when it comes to your personal information. Technology is great at handling your information; it is probably better than you at remembering the specifics and details of everything that is you! But if you think about it...maybe that's precisely the reason you should be wary of it.</p>
