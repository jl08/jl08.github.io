        <p>So far the biggest struggle for me has been time management. Even though I did get a lot better than when I first started DBC, I still find myself struggling to finish some assignments at the last minute.

        My thinking style is abstract sequential, and after some research, I found that abstract sequential learners find it difficult when there is not enough time to get through a specific subject thoroughly. This may or may not be why I have trouble with time management, but if so, I am thinking I could probably try skimming through topics that don't require so much focus and basically "pick out" what seems most necessary.

        Seeing that abstract sequential thinkers learn best in when they have someone to refer to for questions,  I should probably try to reach out during tutoring or office hours more often.

        Lastly, I think studying in different environments could be a nice change. I find that maybe being in the same spot all day every day could also add to frustration during long and/or difficult assignments.

        Like coding, I plan to make make changes in increments so that I don't feel overwhelemed and burn out too quickly. Hopefully these small changes can help me with my time management, but even if it doesn't, I still believe they will be valuable in helping me become a more well-rounded person.
