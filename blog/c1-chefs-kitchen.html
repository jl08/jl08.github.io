        <p>I feel that DBC really tries to encourage the idea of working together and trying to grow as an individual. DBC wants us to not just take what we are offered and be okay with it, I think they want us to truly engage in our education and experience there and actually want to better ourselves. I like the fact that DBC wants us to challenge ourselves, and not just absorb what is being fed to us. I feel like it will be a very different experience from anything I have done so far, especially since any type of education I had my whole life was mostly confined to a classroom with a very traditional method of lecture and memorizing.  I am really excited for my time at DBC, especially to be in an environment full of people who share a mutual love for what I want to do and motivate me to work harder.</p>
