     <section>
        <p>What is a <strong>class</strong>?</p>

        <p>Below we have an example of a class called <strong>Die</strong> </p>
        <img src="dieshot.png">

          <p> In the example above, we have created a class <strong>Die</strong> that has three methods:</p>

          <p> initialize</p>
          <p> sides</p>
          <p> roll</p>

          <p> These methods are defined within the <strong>Die</strong> class, making them <strong>instance methods</p>. This just means that these methods can be used by any and all instances of our class <strong>Die</strong>.

          <p> For instance... in our example above, you can call upon any of these methods on Die.</p>

          <p> For example, if I wanted to create a die with 6 sides, I would write...</p>
          <p> my_die = Die.new(6)</p>

          <p> and if I wanted to see how many sides my_die has, I just have to call it like so...</p>

          <p> my_die.sides</p>

          <p> and it would output => 6 </p>

          <p> Another important thing to mention are <strong>instance variables</strong>.</p>

          <p><strong>Instance variables</strong> are different from regular variables in that they can be called upon anytime and anywhere within that class by any method defined by that class.</p>

          <p> In other words, instance variables can be used by different methods as long as they are all within the same class. </p>

          <p> They look different from the variables we are used to by the addition of one symbol: @ that precedes the variable name.</p>

          <p> So in our example above, our <strong>instance variable</strong> is @num_sides. </p>

          <p> Because @num_sides is an instance variable, it can be used in all three methods (initialize, sides, and roll) without it having to be redefined for each method.</p>

          <p> Instance variables are great because not only do they allow our code to look a bit more concise and neat, but it saves a lot of time and prevents redundancy!</p>
