     <section>

     <p>Ambition, Control,Security, Personal Development, and Pleasure are some of the values that bring me most joy, happiness, and satisfaction in life. </p>

     <p> If I had to rate myself on how well I tried to live up to these values, on a scale from 1 to 5 ( 5 being the highest ) I would probably give my self a 3.5</p>
     <p> I wish that it could be higher, but it seems that with everything happening, it does get hard to focus on living up to some of the values I listed.</p>

     <p> If I had to choose a value most important for me, it would probably be Personal Development. I feel like I have only just started to know who I really am as a person this year, and it has brought many mixed feelings.</p>
     <p> I think getting to know myself this year was one of the most important moments of my life because before, I felt like I was aimlessly heading towards something I was unsure of. I always felt so uncertain, and I used to dismiss it as me just being indecisive. </p>

     <p> I am not saying that I know exactly who I am or what I want in life, but I can say with certainty that personal development is of utmost importance for me because with it comes confidence and feelings of security that I never knew existed in me.</p>

     <p> Because I always feel like there is so much I still don't even know about myself, I do find it difficult to give others advice.</p>

     <p> After all, how can I give advice on another person's life when I can barely understand my own?</p>

     <p> The last time I gave someone advice, it was whether or not to take a job in a new city. I think it related to a few of my values, such as pleasure, ambition and security. Whether or not to move to a new city takes a lot of thought-- will you be able to enjoy yourself in this new place? How badly do you want to go there? Are you sure your job there could support your new life out there? The questions could go on, but thinking about such values really can help figure out what's important in life. </p>

     <p> I think if I were to focus more on my values and got to know myself a lot better, it could help me deal with stereotype threats when it occurs.</p>
     <p> Knowing myself and my abilities can help me feel confident enough to not feel like I am "not good enough". Ambition and control would allow me to reinforce the idea that what I set my mind to, I have it in me to see it through-- regardless of what anyone says or thinks of my abilities due to negative stereotyping. </p>
