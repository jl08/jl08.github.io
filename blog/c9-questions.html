        <p> Asking questions is an integral part of the learning experience, which is why it is important that we know how to ask good questions!</p>

        <p> First thing you should keep in mind when asking the question is to make sure that your questions makes sense. This seems obvious at first, but sometimes it can be difficult for others to understand what you are trying to say, even if it sounds simple to you. </p>

        <p> Another thing to keep in mind is to keep the title of your message as concise, but as specific as possible. An easy way to do this is to pretend you are the person reading the message and think, would you want to open this message? If the answer is no, try to re-write the title in a way that would make it more appealing to read.</p>

        <p> Explain in your message exactly what went wrong. Don't just say " this did not work". It would be much helpful if it was explained, what did not work? What were you expecting it do? What did it do instead? Etc. The more specific you are with your questions and messages, the easier it is for the other person to figure out what is going on.</p>

        <p> Lastly, this may seem silly but it actually is very important: formatting correctly. A nicely formatted message is much more easier to read than one huge block of text. Use actual words instead of text-message abbreviations such as "u". Just imagine yourself reading this message from someone else-- would you want to read through this? If the answer is no, once again, go back and try editing the message a bit.</p>

        <p> Although this is just a small list of things to keep in mind, it is just a small start at writing good questions. Only practice makes perfect! So do try to keep some of these pointers in mind, and it will hopefully help out both you and the reader when it comes to answering your questions.</p>
