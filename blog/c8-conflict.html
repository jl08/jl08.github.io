      <p class="blogTitle">Conflicts</p>

      <p class="entryDate">080915</p>

        <p> The most recent conflict I could remember was at work a few weeks ago at the restaurant. It was a somewhat busy night, which means as a server, I could make great money if I worked hard. </p>

        <p>As the night progressed, I realized at a point that I had less tables than certain servers, and even though it was my section's tables that were getting flipped, my tables kept going to other servers. This made me frustrated, because in a system where the hostesses were in control of the amount of tables I could have and in turn make money from, I felt like I was losing not only potential money, but also wasting my time. </p>

        <p>It was after another few rounds of getting skipped when I decided to confront the hostesses. I asked them if they were forgetting to seat me or if there was something else happening that they were planning. Their only answer was that there was a miscommunication issue, to which I felt extremely annoyed. </p>

        <p>I did not want to cause harm to our relationship over a mistake, so I did hold in most of my frustrations while telling them why I was feeling unhappy at the moment. I am glad that I did not go beyond that even though the events at the restaurant that night were all adding stress to that already stressful evening. They then apologized and it really seemed like they understood why I could be a bit upset at the situation. This made me feel better and I was glad that we were able to get over the conflict without any hard feelings or regrettable actions. </p>

        <p>From this, I think I learned that patience can really help you calm down at a heated moment and even prevent conflict altogether. And if a conflict were to occur, I learned that explaining to the other person why I was upset really helps them understand my frustrations. If I were to go back and change something, I would probably have either confronted them earlier about the situation and asked them about it in a casual way, just as a checkup. This could have probably prevented some long explanations and frustrations built up.</p>
