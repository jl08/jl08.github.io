        <p>A little bit about myself...</p>

        <p> My name is Jenny, and I will be attending DBC in New York this August.</p>

        <p> It's been a little over half a year since I started to learn HTML/CSS as a hobby to kill some time before graduate school. I had no idea that that I would love it enough to actually drop what I was doing and invest my time into programming instead! </p>

        <p> What is even more strange is when I started DBC, I had originally wanted to focus more on HTML/CSS but now that we are getting deeper into Ruby, I find it much more interesting (and almost addicting). </p>

        <p> I find myself loving programming more and more each day and am so excited for what lays ahead.</p>
